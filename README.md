# 👋 Hi, I'm Davis!

Welcome to my GitHub! I am passionate about both **software development** and **cybersecurity**, and I love exploring the intersection of the two. My goal is to continuously learn, build, and share my projects while refining my skills in both fields.

## 💻 Software Development
I primarily focus on **Python**, using it for **web development** and automation. My projects range from Flask-based web applications to fun Python scripts that solve real-world problems. I'm currently expanding my knowledge into **AI-driven development**, specifically **LangChain**, and exploring more programming languages that I can eventually bring to a team setting.

You can check out some of my notable software projects here:
- 🏦 **[Flask Budget App](https://github.com/dabu3393/Budget-App-Flask)** – A financial tracking web app.
- ⌨️ **[Typing Speed Test](https://github.com/dabu3393/Typing-Speed-Python)** – A Python-based typing speed game.
- 🕹 **[Pong Game](https://github.com/dabu3393/Pong-Game-Python)** – A fun arcade-style game built in Python.

## 🔐 Cybersecurity & Red Teaming
I completed the **University of Denver's Cybersecurity Bootcamp**, where I developed a strong foundation in **network security, penetration testing, and ethical hacking**. My primary interest is in **Red Team operations**, where I focus on offensive security tactics.

I regularly test my skills by solving **Hack The Box (HTB) machines**, and I document my findings to help others learn. My write-ups include:
- 🚀 **[HTB Writeups](https://github.com/Dabu3393-CTF/HTB-CTF-Writeups)** – Step-by-step breakdowns of exploited machines.
<!-- - 🛠 **[Pentesting Scripts](https://github.com/Dabu3393-CTF/Pentesting-Scripts)** – Tools and scripts I use for penetration testing.
- 🔎 **OSINT & Red Team Playbooks** – Reconnaissance strategies and adversarial tactics. -->

## 🎯 Bringing It All Together
I enjoy tackling **challenging problems** from both a **development** and **security** perspective. Whether it's **building secure applications** or **breaking into them ethically**, I love applying my technical knowledge in a practical and meaningful way. My goal is to merge my **software engineering** background with **offensive cybersecurity** to contribute to security-conscious development teams.

If you're interested in **collaborating, discussing cybersecurity, or just connecting**, feel free to reach out!
